I would like to build a demo for my portfolio. The demo uses mujoco to simulate a humanoid robot wandering. The demo will showcase the capabilities of the humanoid robot in terms of its mobility and interaction with the environment. The robot will be able to navigate through a virtual environment, avoiding obstacles and navigating to locations specified by the user. 

The public user will be able to interact with the demo by selecting different objects for the robotic arm to pick up and place in different locations. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily understand how to control the robotic arm and observe its performance.
